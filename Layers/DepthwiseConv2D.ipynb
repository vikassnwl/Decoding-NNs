    "## **DepthwiseConv2D Layer**\n",
    "The `DepthwiseConv2D` layer is a specialized type of convolutional layer that performs **depthwise separable convolution**, splitting the convolution into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Depthwise Convolution**:\n",
    "   - Applies a separate convolutional kernel (filter) to each input channel independently.\n",
    "   - This reduces the computational cost compared to standard convolution, which mixes information across all channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pointwise Convolution** (optional):\n",
    "   - Typically followed by a **1x1 convolution** (not part of `DepthwiseConv2D` itself) to combine the depthwise output and mix information across channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Works**\n",
    "- **Input Shape**: `(batch_size, height, width, channels)`\n",
    "- **Depthwise Filters**: A separate convolution filter is applied to each input channel.\n",
    "  - If there are \\( C \\) input channels, then \\( C \\) filters are applied.\n",
    "  - Each filter has its own learnable weights.\n",
    "- **Output Shape**: `(batch_size, height', width', channels * depth_multiplier)`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Parameters**\n",
    "1. **`kernel_size`**:\n",
    "   - Specifies the size of the convolution filter (e.g., `(3, 3)` for a 3x3 filter).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`strides`**:\n",
    "   - Controls the stride of the convolution (default is `(1, 1)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`padding`**:\n",
    "   - Specifies how to handle the borders:\n",
    "     - `'valid'`: No padding.\n",
    "     - `'same'`: Padding added to keep the output size the same as the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`depth_multiplier`**:\n",
    "   - The number of depthwise filters per input channel. Default is `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`activation`**:\n",
    "   - Activation function applied after the convolution (e.g., `'relu'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`use_bias`**:\n",
    "   - If `True`, adds a bias term to the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages**\n",
    "1. **Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - Reduces the number of parameters and computational cost compared to standard convolution.\n",
    "   - Particularly useful in lightweight architectures like **MobileNet**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Flexibility**:\n",
    "   - Allows fine-grained control over channel-wise operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Code**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras.layers import DepthwiseConv2D\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a DepthwiseConv2D layer\n",
    "depthwise_conv = DepthwiseConv2D(kernel_size=(3, 3), strides=(1, 1), padding='same')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Input: (batch_size, height, width, channels)\n",
    "input_data = tf.random.normal([1, 28, 28, 3])  # Example: 1 image, 28x28, 3 channels\n",
    "\n",
    "# Apply the layer\n",
    "output = depthwise_conv(input_data)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Input Shape:\", input_data.shape)\n",
    "print(\"Output Shape:\", output.shape)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Applications**\n",
    "- Used in **lightweight CNNs** like **MobileNet** and **EfficientNet** for reducing model size and improving inference speed.\n",
    "- Suitable for tasks requiring efficient computation on edge devices (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices)."
