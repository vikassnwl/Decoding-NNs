    "\n",
    "The model selects a word from the list of predicted tokens based on their probabilities, influenced by the **temperature** setting. Here’s how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prediction of Token Probabilities**:  \n",
    "    The model outputs a probability distribution over its vocabulary for the next token. For example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```vbnet\n",
    "    Token: [ \"cat\", \"dog\", \"bird\" ]\n",
    "    Probabilities: [ 0.6, 0.3, 0.1 ]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Apply Temperature Scaling**:  \n",
    "    Each probability is adjusted by dividing the token logits (raw scores) by the temperature (`T`), then applying the softmax function:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Lower `T` (e.g., 0.5): Makes high-probability tokens more dominant (sharpened distribution).\n",
    "    * Higher `T` (e.g., 2.0): Makes probabilities more uniform (flattened distribution).\n",
    "3. **Sampling from the Distribution**:  \n",
    "    After adjusting probabilities, the model samples a token:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * With **deterministic settings (e.g., `temperature=0`)**, the token with the highest probability is chosen (greedy sampling).\n",
    "    * With **non-deterministic settings (e.g., `temperature > 0`)**, a token is randomly chosen based on its adjusted probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* At `T=0.5`: \"cat\" is highly likely to be chosen.\n",
    "* At `T=2.0`: \"dog\" or even \"bird\" has a better chance of being picked despite their lower original probabilities.\n",

    "* * *\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, at **T=2.0**, it is still possible for the model to choose \"cat,\" but the likelihood decreases compared to lower temperatures. The probability distribution becomes more uniform as the temperature increases, so even lower-probability tokens (like \"dog\" or \"bird\") have a higher chance of being selected.\n",

    "* **At T < 1**: High-probability tokens are amplified (distribution becomes sharper).\n",
    "* **At T > 1**: The probabilities are flattened (less probable tokens get a boost).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Adjustments:  \n",
    "For `T = 0.5`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```vbnet\n",

    "\n",
    "* **T = 0**: Always \"red\" (most likely token).\n",
    "* **T = 0.5**: \"red\" 90% of the time, \"blue\" or \"green\" rarely chosen.\n",

    "What are adjusted probabilities for T=0\n",

    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT:**\n",
    "\n",
    "At **temperature = 0**, the model behaves deterministically. The **adjusted probabilities** are not computed in the usual way, since the temperature causes the model to always pick the token with the highest raw probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Raw Probabilities**:  \n",
    "    The model outputs raw probabilities (logits) for each token:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```vbnet\n",
    "    Token: [ \"red\", \"blue\", \"green\" ]  \n",
    "    Raw Probabilities: [ 0.7, 0.2, 0.1 ]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Temperature Scaling Formula**:  \n",
    "    The temperature scaling formula is:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $$P_{adjusted} = \\frac{\\text{exp}(logit / T)}{\\sum \\text{exp}(logit / T)}$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    When **T = 0**, the formula results in a division by zero due to `logit / 0`. This causes the model to focus entirely on the **highest raw probability**, making all other tokens irrelevant.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Effect of T=0**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * The token with the highest raw probability (`\"red\"` in this case, with 0.7) gets **100% probability**.\n",
    "    * All other tokens (e.g., `\"blue\"` and `\"green\"`) receive **0% probability**.\n",

    "* \"red\" → 1.0\n",
    "* \"blue\" → 0.0\n",
    "* \"green\" → 0.0\n",

    "Yes, by \"original probabilities,\" I mean the **raw probabilities** (or logits) that the model generates before applying any temperature scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "At **T = 1**, the temperature scaling has **no effect** on the logits. The raw logits (or unscaled probabilities) are passed directly as the adjusted probabilities, so the model chooses tokens based on these values without any modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Raw Probabilities (logits)**: The initial output from the model for each token (e.g., \"red\" → 0.7, \"blue\" → 0.2, \"green\" → 0.1).\n",
    "* **Temperature = 1**: The model uses these **raw probabilities directly** as the adjusted probabilities. The logits are not changed, and the model picks tokens based on the original distribution.\n",
