    "When building a `tf.data` pipeline, you should apply **data augmentation** **before shuffling and batching**. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Augmentation First**:  \n",
    "    Applying data augmentation before batching ensures that each individual data sample is augmented independently. This helps create a diverse dataset and prevents batching from affecting augmentation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Shuffling and Batching Later**:  \n",
    "    Shuffling improves randomness, which is important for breaking the inherent order in the data. Batching afterward groups the data into smaller sets to optimize computation during training.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended Order**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load and preprocess the dataset.\n",
    "2. Apply data augmentation.\n",
    "3. Shuffle the dataset.\n",
    "4. Batch the dataset.\n",
    "5. Prefetch the dataset (optional, for performance)."
